# Mixture GAN
Generalizing GANs Through Symmetric Mixtures and Noise Augmentation:
Insights from MNIST and Toy Experiments

Extending the vanilla GAN approach by learning to distinguish not just between real and generated data, but either mixtures of them or noisy versions of them. Taking the first steps in understanding how the approach will help in more stable GAN training.
